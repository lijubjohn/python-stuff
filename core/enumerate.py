"""
A lot of times when dealing with iterators, we also get a need to keep a count of iterations. Python eases the programmers’ task by providing a built-in function enumerate() for this task.
Enumerate() method adds a counter to an iterable and returns it in a form of enumerate object. This enumerate object can then be used directly in for loops or be converted into a list of tuples using list() method.


enumerate(iterable, start=0)

Parameters:
Iterable: any object that supports iteration
Start: the index value from which the counter is
              to be started, by default it is 0

# Python program to illustrate
# enumerate function

# creating enumerate objects
obj1 = enumerate(l1)
obj2 = enumerate(s1)

print("Return type:", type(obj1))
print(list(enumerate(l1)))

# changing start index to 2 from 0
print(list(enumerate(s1, 2)))




# Python program to illustrate
# enumerate function in loops
l1 = ["eat", "sleep", "repeat"]

# printing the tuples in object directly
for ele in enumerate(l1):
    print(type(ele))
    print(ele)
print
# changing index and printing separately
for count, ele in enumerate(l1, 100):
